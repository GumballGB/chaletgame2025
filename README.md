Silly game for chalet


TO RUN THE BACKEND, YOU NEED TO MAKE THE POSTGRES DATABASE
Open the terminal and run:
psql -U postgres

It will ask for the password, the password for user 'postgres'.
Afterwards, write the next command:
CREATE DATABASE quizgame;

You can check if it has been added by doing the '\l' command.
(note in application.properties, you set the password to your 'postgres' password)
